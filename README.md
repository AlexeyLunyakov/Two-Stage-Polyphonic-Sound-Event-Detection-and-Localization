# Polyphonic-Sound-Event-Detection-and-Localization-using-a-Two-Stage-Strategy

Sound event detection (SED) and localization refer to recognizing sound events and estimating their spatial and temporal locations. In this repo, a Two-Stage Polyphonic Sound Event Detection and Localization method is implemented using pytorch. This method is tested on the DCASE 2019 Task 3 Sound Event Localization and Detection. More description of this task can be found in http://dcase.community/challenge2019/task-sound-event-localization-and-detection.
